# This file contains pin mappings for BIGTREETECH SKR mini
# E3 v3.0. To use this config, during "make menuconfig" select the
# STM32G0B1 with a "8KiB bootloader" and USB communication.

# Flash this firmware by copying "out/klipper.bin" to a SD card and
# turning on the printer with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.
